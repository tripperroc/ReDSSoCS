 Thank you for completing the survey! We have one last favor to ask of you, for which 
  we will pay you up to $15. Would you be willing to help us find 
  other adult gay male friends to take the survey? 

  We will give you $5 in Amazon.com credit for each of the first three friends of yours who 
  takes the survey.  Here is a sample email you may use,
  however it is only necessary to provide the link below.
